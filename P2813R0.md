# Abstract

This paper reworded P2477R3 to make it easier to understand. And responding to the review opinions and provide some design alternatives for the original design comments. See [summary](#summary) for the conclusion quickly.

# Prefer co_elision than coro_elision

There is a comment that we should use co_elision since it is more
consistent with `co_await`, `co_yield` and `co_return`. We'll adopt
this in the next revision for P2477.

# Rewording for P2477R3

This section tries to reword P2477R3 shortly to make it easier
to read and understand. People can read [P2477R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2477r3.html) for more contexts. Following off the section is the rewording
of P2477R3. (1) introduces `std::co_elision` to standard library. (2) tries to define coroutine elision formally. (3) tells the design of P2477R3.

(1) There is a new enum class `co_elision` in std namespace. The enum class `co_elision` has
three state: `may`, `always` and `never`.

(2) A call is a coroutine call if the call calls a coroutine.
For a coroutine call, an implementation may allocate additional storage for its coroutine state by calling a non-array allocation function. If the coroutine state is not
allocated by calling the allocation function, we call the coroutine call is **coro elided**. If the coroutine call is coro elided, the lifetime of the coroutine state is the same with
a local variable in the enclosing block of the coroutine call.

(3) For every call, if the callee **can be recognized** as a coroutine,
the compiler will try to evalute the expression at constexpr time: ``std::coroutine_traits<RetType, ArgTypes>::promise_type::must_elide(args...)``, where the `RetType` is the return type of the callee and
`ArgTypes` are the types of the arguments and `args...` is the argument of the call. If the type of the expression is not `std::co_elision`, the program is ill-formed. If the result of the expression is `std::co_elision::always`, the call is guaranteed to be coro elided. If the result result of the expression is `std::co_elision::never`, the call is guaranteed to not be coro elided. Otherwise (the expression is invalid, the compiler can't evaluate it at constexpr time or the result is `std::co_elision::may`), it is up to the compiler to coro elide the call or not (status quo).

# Limitations of P2477R3

The limitation of the approach in P2477 is worded at the first sentence of (3):

> For every call, if the callee **can be recognized** as a coroutine, ...

The sentence implies that not all coroutine calls can be recognized as coroutine calls. For direct calls, this requires that the coroutine definition should be reachable to the call. For indirect calls, compilers can't tell if it is a coroutine calls natually.

# Concerns of P2477R3

A concern for the approach is that it is an undefined behavior (probably a segmentation fault in practice) if the user force the compiler to coro elide a call which is not safe to be coro elided. Note that in this case, the call must be recognized as a coroutine call.

The concern is actually the motivation of the paper. Since currently the compiler can recognize 3 state for coroutine elision: safe, unsafe and unknown. The unknown state takes most of time. To avoid miscompilation, the compiler treats all unknown state as unsafe state now.

And there are indeed cases that the compiler can recognize that it is clearly unsafe to elide calls. But I think we shouldn't define these cases in the language spec and we should leave the space for the analysis tools to diagnose these cases.

So here I said `UB` doesn't mean a compiler can refuse to elide a recognizable coroutine call which is foreced by the programmer. The compiler should still coro elide it. The `UB` here means that it is a `UB` to access a dangling pointer.

# The definition of "can't be coro elided"

I feel we were a little bit confused about the phrase `can't be coro elided` during the review. One meaning of `can't be coro elided` is that the user want the compiler to coro elide a specific coroutine call but the compiler can't coro elide the call due to implementation limits. Another meaning of `can't be coro elided` is that the program will be broken after coro eliding the call. Here let's take the first meaning during this topic for clearness. And let's say `it is unsafe to coro elide` for the second meaning.

# Only allow the programmer to prohibit coroutine elision

If we are really scared by the UB, this alternative is clearly acceptable since there are corresponding use case too. We can achieve the alternative easily by removing `std::co_elision::always` from P2477R3.

# Is it really scary or hard to force coroutine elision?

From my point of view, the behavior of coroutine elision is well defined and it is easy to understand as long as the users can understand that the lifetime of a coro elided coroutine status is the same with a local variable in the enclosing block and we shouldn't access the objects after its lifetime ends. I think it makes sense to assume this is easy to understand for C++ programmers. And from my experience, many my collegues can understant coroutine elision when they don't know much about the design and implementation for coroutines. Also such `UB` is easy to be caught by address sanitizer in practice. Last I want to emphasize that it is completely OK for users who don't want to use it for any reason. It won't make things worse in any sense.

# Can the compiler give an error when the compiler fails to coro elide a call when required

As discussed above, here we talk about the first meaning of "can't be coro elided".

The answer should be NO under the framework of P2477R3.
The logic behind is that the compiler would/could evaluate ``std::coroutine_traits<RetType, ArgTypes>::promise_type::must_elide(args...)`` if the compiler knows the call is a coroutine call first. And if the compiler failed to know the call is a coroutine call, the compiler woulnd't evalute ``std::coroutine_traits<RetType, ArgTypes>::promise_type::must_elide(args...)``, so the compiler is not required to coro elide the call. There is a cyclic logic! So the compiler can't give an error when the compiler fails to coro elide a call.

There was a comment that we can diagnose this by linking errors. But we can't make it if some calls get coro elided and other calls doesn't for the same promise_type. For example,

```C++
Task elidable_task(std::co_elision kind);
Task another_elidable_task(std::co_elision kind) { ... }

int foo() {
    auto t1 = elidable_task(std::co_elision::always);
    auto t2 = another_elidable_task(std::co_elision::never);
}
```

Now in the current TU, there will always be a `Task::promise_type::operator new(...)` function in the current TU so we can't diagnose it by linking errors.

# Is there any method to give an error when the compiler fails to coro elide a call when required?

It is possible to make it if we can introduce new concepts to make the compiler understand that they are calling a coroutine without seeing the coroutine body.

## Method 1 - coro specifier
For example, it is possible if we force every coroutine function should have `coro` specifier in its declaration just like `const`. For example,

```C++
Task unreachable_definition() coro;
auto foo() {
    co_return co_await unreachable_definition();
}
```

Now the compiler can try to evalute ``std::coroutine_traits<Task>::promise_type::must_elide()`` without seeing the body of `unreachable_definition()`. And if the expression evalutes to `std::co_elision::always` and the compiler can't find the definition, the compiler can give an error easily and immediately.

But the downside of the design is that it is a breaking change. Since it requires that all the coroutine function should be marked with `coro` so that all the all codes can't work immediately after they upgrade the version. This is not acceptable.

## Method 2 - Tell the compiler we're calling a coroutine at the call site

For example, we can mimic the style of `std::invoke` to create a new magic function `std::co_invoke(func, args...)`. Then the semantics of `std::co_invoke(func, args...)` should be that the callee must be known to be a coroutine. So that we can evalute ``std::coroutine_traits<RetType, ArgTypes>::promise_type::must_elide(args...)`` now. Then if the callee is not known to be a coroutine, the compiler can give an error.

If we feel good with the idea of `std::co_invoke(...)`, we can remove the design in P2477R3 further by introducing `std::co_elide_invoke(...)` and `std::co_never_invoke(...)`.

The downside of the approach is that the coroutine codes may be much uglier then...

# Summary

If we are still scared by potential mix-use UB, we should accept P2477R3 without `std::co_elision::always`.

If we allow the compiler to be silent when we want to coro elide a call which are unable to be coro elided, we can accept P2477R3.

Otherwise we should find solutions like `std::co_invoke`, `std::co_elide_invoke` to tell the compiler we're calling a coroutine.
